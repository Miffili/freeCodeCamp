### Random Quote Machine for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-random-quote-machine)

#### Assignment
Build a random quote machine. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.  
Fulfill the below **user stories**:
- as a user, I can click a button to show a new random quote  
- as a user, I can press a button to tweet out a quote

#### Implementation
I decided to code a simple version of this assignment without any libraries or APIs. The quotes are picked from different sources, all of them inspirational on the topic success/failure. The design should be as simple as possible, but with a little twist. The hue of the background changes randomly with every new quote, additionally the quotee is displayed tone-in-tone if the screen is big enough.

#### Made with
- HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript  
- Twitter Web Intent
