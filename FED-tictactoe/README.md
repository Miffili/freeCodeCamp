### Tic Tac Toe for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-tic-tac-toe-game)

#### Assignment
Build a Tic Tac Toe Game. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.  
Fulfill the below **user stories**:  
- as a user, I can play a game of Tic Tac Toe with the computer   
- my game will reset as soon as it's over so I can play again  
- as a user, I can choose whether I want to play as X or O

#### Implementation
The last two projects for the Front End Development Certificate are games. The Tic Tac Toe was a challenge in terms of building the AI for the cpu. With this project I got a better understanding of recursion and the minimax algorithmus. Once I figured it all out it was really fun to build this game.

#### Made with
- HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript
