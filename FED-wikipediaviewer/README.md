### Wikipedia Viewer for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-wikipedia-viewer)

#### Assignment
Build a Wikipedia Viewer. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.  
Fulfill the below **user stories**:
- as a user, I can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries  
- as a user, I can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry  

#### Implementation
Another challenge using an API. I have to admit that familiarizing with the APIs one took a little longer this time. But it worked out all just fine in the end. With this project, I decided to stick with certain style elements throughout all of the intermediate & advanced projects. After all cutting down on choices to make is what made a lot of people successful. :wink: 

#### Made with
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- jQuery  
- Icons made by Freepik from [www.flaticon.com](www.flaticon.com) (licensed by CC 3.0 BY)
