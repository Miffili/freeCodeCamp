### Use the Twitch.tv JSON API for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api)

#### Assignment
Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.  
Fulfill the below **user stories**:
- as a user, I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv  
- as a user, I can click the status output & be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel  

#### Implementation
Another challenge using an API. I have to admit that familiarizing with the APIs took a little longer this time. But it worked out all just fine in the end. With this project, I decided to stick with certain style elements to achieve a certain look throughout all of the intermediate & advanced projects. After all cutting down on choices to make is what made a lot of people successful. :wink: 

#### Made with
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- jQuery  
- official Twitch icons
