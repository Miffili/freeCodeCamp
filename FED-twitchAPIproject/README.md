### Twitch.tv Previewer for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/use-the-twitchtv-json-api)

#### Assignment
Use the Twitch.tv JSON API. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.  
Fulfill the below **user stories**:
- as a user, I can see whether Free Code Camp is currently streaming on Twitch.tv  
- as a user, I can click the status output & be sent directly to the Free Code Camp's Twitch.tv channel  
- if a Twitch user is currently streaming, I can see additional details about what they are streaming

#### Implementation
This was a fun project as well. I occasional watch speed runs of classic Nintendo games and working on this project, I found a few new channels. The styling is based on the original look of Twitch, as their Brand Assets have clear rules of usage attached to them, but I still managed to give it my own little twist.
The Twitch API v5 is easy to use and well documented. I really enjoy figuring out, which data is given & what to work with.

#### Made with
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- jQuery  
- official Twitch icons  
- Twitch API v5 (working until 12/31/2018)
