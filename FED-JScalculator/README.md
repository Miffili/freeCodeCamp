### Build a JavaScript Calculator for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-javascript-calculator)

#### Assignment
Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.  
Fulfill the below **user stories**:
- as a user, I can add, subtract, multiply and divide two numbers  
- as a user, I can clear the input field with a clear button  
- as a user, I can keep chaining mathematical operations together until I hit the equal button, and the calculator will tell me the correct output

#### Implementation
This is the first advanced project for freeCodeCamp. I was really thrilled to use vanilla JavaScript again and excited because there was a lot to think of in order to publish a working calculator, e.g. not displaying outside of the calculator itself, no multiple zeros in the beginning of the input, allowing only one decimal point... :innocent:

#### Made with
- HTML, CSS, vanilla JavaScript
