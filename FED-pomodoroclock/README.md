### Simon Game for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/build-a-simon-game)

#### Assignment
Build a Simon Game. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.  
Fulfill the below **user stories**:
- as a user, I am presented with a random series of button presses  
- each time I input a series of button presses correctly, I see the same series of button presses but with an additional step  
- I hear a sound that corresponds to each button both when the series of button presses plays, and when I personally press a button  
- if I press the wrong button, I am notified that I have done so, and that series of button presses starts again to remind me of the pattern so I can try again  
- I can see how many steps are in the current series of button presses  
- if I want to restart, I can hit a button to do so, and the game will return to a single step  
- I can play in strict mode where if I get a button press wrong, it notifies me that I have done so, and the game restarts at a new random series of button presses  
- I can win the game by getting a series of 20 steps correct. I am notified of my victory, then the game starts over
