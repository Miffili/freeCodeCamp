### Weather App for [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/challenges/show-the-local-weather)

#### Assignment
Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.  
Fulfill the below **user stories**:
- as a user, I can see the weather in my current location  
- as a user, I can see a different icon or background image (e.g. snowy mountain, hot desert) depending on the weather  
- as a user, I can push a button to toggle between Fahrenheit & Celsius

#### Implementation
The first challenge of this application was to figure out how to fetch the data. After figuring out how to do it and what kind of information would be given through the API, I decided to design yet another simple interface similar to the Random Quote Machine. The background adapts to the time of day according to the fetched data and the icons change according to the weather in the specific location.  
While the app waits for permission to use users location, a simple loading screen with animated elements is shown.  
If the user declines permission, the weather for [Null Island](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Null_Island) is shown.

#### Made with
